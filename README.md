# BCG X Data Science

This repository contains the work completed during the BCG Data Science Virtual Experience Program on The Forage. The program simulates the role of a data scientist at BCG X, focusing on solving real-world business problems through data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. The project involves advising PowerCo, a fictional gas and electricity utility, on strategies to reduce customer churn.

## About Me

ðŸš€ About Me
Hi! I'm a passionate student currently diving deep into Machine Learning and Data Science. I'm enrolled in a Data Science bootcamp where I'm building real-world projects to apply what I learnâ€”from data wrangling and visualization to model building and evaluation.

My goal is to become a data scientist who not only understands algorithms but also solves meaningful problems with data. I love working on practical applications and constantly seek opportunities to improve my skills through hands-on experience.

ðŸ“Š Tools & Topics Iâ€™m exploring: Python â€¢ Pandas â€¢ NumPy â€¢ Scikit-learn â€¢ Matplotlib â€¢ SQL â€¢ Deep Learning
